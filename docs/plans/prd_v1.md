## Overview
Freelance Tracker will be an application that can be used by any freelancer to keep track of their clients, projects, timesheets, and invoices. It's essentially a CRM with project tracking capabilities.

## Deployment Platform
Initially Freelance Tracker will be a standalone web application that runs on a single workstation. For example, a freelancer user can set up and run the application on their MacBook. Data should be saved to a local/internal SQLLite database.
